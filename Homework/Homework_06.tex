	\item [Exercise 6A.7(a)] ~ (5 points)
	
	Establish the relation between $K$ and $K_C$ for the reaction: \ch{H2CO(g) <-> CO(g) + H2(g)}
	
	\vspace{18em}
	\item [Exercise 6A.10(a)] ~ (5 points)
	
	The standard Gibbs energy of formation of \ch{NH3(g)} is $-16.5~\nicefrac{kJ}{mol}$ at $298~K$. What is the reaction Gibbs energy when the partial pressures of the \ch{N2}, \ch{H2}, and \ch{NH3} (treated as perfect gases) are $3.0~bar$, $1.0~bar$, and $4.0~bar$, respectively? What is the spontaneous direction of the reaction in this case?

	\item [Exercise 6B.1(a)] ~ (5 points)
	
	The standard reaction enthalpy of \ch{Zn(s) + H2O(g) <-> ZnO(s) + H2(g)} is approximately constant at $+224~\nicefrac{kJ}{mol}$ from $920~K$ up to $1280~K$. The standard reaction Gibbs energy is $+33~\nicefrac{kJ}{mol}$ at $1280~K$. Estimate the temperature at which the equilibrium constant becomes greater than 1.

	\item [Exercise 6C.2(a)] ~ (15 points)
	
	Devise cells in which the following are the reactions and calculate the standard cell potential in each case. Write your devised cell using line notation (e.g. \ch{Cd|Cd(NO3)2(aq)||NiCl2(aq)|Ni})
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \ch{Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq) -> ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)}
		
		\vspace{6em}
		\item \ch{2 AgCl(s) + H2(g) -> 2 HCl(aq) + a Ag(s)}
		
		\vspace{6em}
		\item \ch{2 H2(g) + O2(g) -> 2 H2O(l)}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\vspace{6em}
	
	\item [Exercise 6C.3(a)] ~ (5 points)
	
	Use the Debye-H\"uckel limiting law and the Nernst equation to estimate the potential of the cell \ch{Ag|AgBr(s)|KBr(aq,~ $0.050~\nicefrac{mol}{kg}$ \!)||Cd(NO3)2(aq,~ $0.010~\nicefrac{mol}{kg}$ \!)|Cd} at $25^\circ C$.
	
	\vspace{25em}
	\item [Exercise 6D.1(a)] ~ (10 points)
	
	Calculate equilibrium constants of the following reactions at $25^\circ C$ from standard potential data:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \ch{Sn(s) + Sn^{4+}(aq) <-> 2 Sn^{2+}(aq)}
		
		\vspace{10em}
		\item \ch{Sn(s) + 2 AgCl(s) <-> SnCl2(aq) + 2 Ag(s)}
	\end{enumerate}

\section*{\emph{Pioneers}}
\paragraph{By Carol Lynn Pearson}~
\begin{verse}
	My people were Mormon pioneers.\\	
	Is the blood still good?\\	
	They stood in awe as truth\\
	Flew by like a dove\\
	And dropped a feather in the West.\\
	Where truth flies you follow\\	
	If you are a pioneer.\\
	I have searched the skies\\
	And now and then\\
	Another feather has fallen.\\
	I have packed the handcart again\\	
	Packed it with the precious things\\
	And thrown away the rest.\\
	I will sing by the fires at night\\	
	Out there on uncharted ground\\
	Where I am my own captain of tens\\	
	Where I blow the bugle\\
	Bring myself to morning prayer\\
	Map out the miles\\
	And never know when or where\\
	Or if at all I will finally say,\\
	“This is the place,”\\
	I face the plains\\
	On a good day for walking.\\
	The sun rises\\
	And the mist clears.\\
	I will be all right:\\
	My people were Mormon Pioneers.
\end{verse}
