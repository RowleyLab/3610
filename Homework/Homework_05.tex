	      At $300~K$, the partial vapor pressure of \ch{HCl} (that is, the partial pressure of the \ch{HCl} vapor) in liquid \ch{GeCl4} is as follows:

	      \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
		      $\chi_{\ch{HCl}}$   & $0.005$ & $0.012$ & $0.019$ \\
		      $p_{\ch{HCl}}(kPa)$ & $32.0$  & $76.9$  & $121.8$
	      \end{tabular}

	      Show that the solution obeys Henry's law in this range of mole fractions, and calculate the Henry's law constant at $300~K$

	      The vapor pressure of benzene is $53.3~kPa$ at $60.6^\circ C$, but it fell to $51.5~kPa$ when $19.0~g$ of a non-volatile organic copound was dissolved in $500~g$ of benzene. Calculate the molar mass of the compound

	\item [My Problem 1] ~ (10 points)

	      Below are the bubble-point and dew-point curves (liquid/vapor composition curves) for a mixture of hexane in heptane. Consider a mixture of $10.0~g$ of hexane in $10.0~g$ of heptane at $T=85^\circ C$. Find the following for this mixture: $\circled{1}$ The compositions of the liquid and vapor phases, and $\circled{2}$ the fraction of molecules in the liquid phase. Note that the curves have been fit to cubic functions, which allows for precise answers.

	\item [My Problem 2] ~ (5 points)

	      Below are the composition curves for a certain azeotrope. Suppose you have a sample of this mixture with composition $Z_A = a$ (the dashed line marked $a$). In the limit of a many-stage distillation carried out until compositions are stable, what will be the compositions of the liquid and vapor phases?

	\item [My Problem 3] ~ (10 points)

	      Below are the composition curves for a mixture near its freezing point. The eutectic composition ($e_2$ in the figure) is at $\chi_B = 0.42$. Suppose you have a liquid with $3.0~moles$ of $B$ and $1.0~mole$ of $A$. This mixture has $\chi_B=0.75$ ($a$ in the figure), and is cooled slowly until it just reaches the eutectic freezing point. Find the following at this point: $\circled{1}$ The compositions of the solid and liquid phases, and $\circled{2}$ the number of moles in the solid phase.

	\item [Exercise 5F.3(a)] ~ (5 points)

	      Estimate the mean ionic activity coefficient ($\gamma_\pm$) and activity of a solution at $25^\circ C$ that is $0.010~\nicefrac{mol}{kg}$ \ch{CaCl2(aq)} and $0.030~\nicefrac{mol}{kg}$ \ch{NaF(aq)}.

	      \vspace{18em}
	\item [My Problem 4] ~ (10 points)

	      \ch{CaF2} is a sparingly soluble salt whose solubility product is $K_{SP}=1.6\times10^{-10}$. Give the molar concentration of \ch{CaF2} in $\circled{1}$ pure water, and $\circled{2}$ an aqueous solution buffered with $0.50~molal$ \ch{NaNO3}. Use the extended Debye-H\"uckel law, with $A=0.5085$ and $B=0.9843$ (values for water at $25^\circ C$ and typical ion sizes).
