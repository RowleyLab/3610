	\subsection*{Problem 1 (5 points)}
Consider a spring which obeys Hook's law: $F=-kx$ where $x$ is the displacement away from equilibrium and $k=650\dfrac{N}{m}$. The acceleration due to gravity is $9.80665~\dfrac{m}{s^2}$.

$\circ$ Calculate the equilibrium displacement if a $10~kg$ weight is placed on the spring

	\subsection*{Problem 2  (5 points)}	
Considering the same weight-on-a-spring in Problem 1:

$\circ$ Calculate the work done by the falling weight.

	\subsection*{Problem 3 (5 points)}
How much work would be done if instead the spring was stretched reversibly to the same equilibrium displacement. Bonus -- Explain the discrepancy!

	\subsection*{Problem 4 (5 points)}
The spring-weight system will lose kinetic energy through friction with the air until it rests at its equilibrium position. What is $\Delta S_{universe}$ for both the reversible and irreversible processes if they are done at room temperature ($25^\circ C$)?
