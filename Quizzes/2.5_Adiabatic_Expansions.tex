\subsection*{Question 1}
An ideal diatomic gas at $25 ^\circ C$ starts at a volume of $1.50~L$ and a pressure of $0.82~atm$, and undergoes a reversible adiabatic compression to $0.325~L$

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the final pressure after the compression
	
	\vspace{5em}
	\item Find the final temperature after the compression
	
	\vspace{5em}
	\item Find the work ($w_{sys}$) for this process
	
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
Reversible adiabatic changes involve work, no heat exchange, and are not isochoric, so why are able to use the equation $\Delta U = C_V\Delta T$ when analyzing adiabatic changes?

\vspace{6em}
\subsection*{Question 3}
Reversible adiabatic changes involve no heat exchange, so why are the solutions to Question 1 different for monoatomic, diatomic, and non-linear polyatomic gases?

\paragraph{By Rudyard Kippling}~
\begin{verse}
	If you can keep your head when all about you\\
	\hspace{0.5em} Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\\
	If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} But make allowance for their doubting too;\\
	If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\\
	Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
	
	If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;\\
	\hspace{0.5em} If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;\\
	If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\\
	\hspace{0.5em} And treat those two impostors just the same;\\
	If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken\\
	\hspace{0.5em} Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\\
	Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
	
	If you can make one heap of all your winnings\\
	\hspace{0.5em} And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\\
	And lose, and start again at your beginnings\\
	\hspace{0.5em} And never breathe a word about your loss;\\
	If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\\
	\hspace{0.5em} To serve your turn long after they are gone,\\
	And so hold on when there is nothing in you\\
	\hspace{0.5em} Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
	
	If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,\\
	If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} If all men count with you, but none too much;\\
	If you can fill the unforgiving minute\\
	\hspace{0.5em} With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,\\
	Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
\end{verse}
