Below are the bubble-point and dew-point curves (liquid/vapor composition curves) for a mixture of hexane in heptane. Consider a mixture of $10.0~g$ of hexane in $10.0~g$ of heptane at $T=85^\circ C$. Find the following for this mixture: $\circled{1}$ The compositions of the liquid and vapor phases, and $\circled{2}$ the fraction of molecules in the liquid phase. Note that the curves have been fit to cubic functions, which allows for precise answers.

Below are the composition curves for a certain azeotrope. Suppose you have a sample of this mixture with composition $Z_A = a$ (the dashed line marked $a$). In the limit of a many-stage distillation carried out until compositions are stable, what will be the compositions of the liquid and vapor phases?

Below are the composition curves for a mixture near its freezing point. The eutectic composition ($e_2$ in the figure) is at $\chi_B = 0.42$. Suppose you have a liquid with $3.0~moles$ of $B$ and $1.0~mole$ of $A$. This mixture has $\chi_B=0.75$ ($a$ in the figure), and is cooled slowly until it just reaches the eutectic freezing point. Find the following at this point: $\circled{1}$ The compositions of the solid and liquid phases, and $\circled{2}$ the number of moles in the solid phase.

		나 하늘로 돌아가리라\\
		새벽빛 와 닿으면 스러지는\\
		이슬 더불어 손에 손을 잡고,
		
		나 하늘로 돌아가리라.\\
		노을빛 함께 단둘이서\\
		기슭에서 놀다가 구름 손짓하며는,
		
		나 하늘로 돌아가리라.\\
		아름다운 이 세상 소풍 끝내는 날,\\
		가서, 아름다웠더라고 말하리라...

	I'll go back to heaven again\\
	hand in hand with the dew\\
	that melts at the touch of the dawning day,
	
	I'll go back to heaven again.\\
	After playing on the slopes with the dusk,\\
	when the clouds beckon, 
	
	I'll go back to heaven again.\\
	On the last day of my outing to this beautiful world,\\
	I'll go back and say: it was beautiful...
