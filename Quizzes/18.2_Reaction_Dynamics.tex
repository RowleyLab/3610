\section*{\emph{When You See Water}}
\paragraph{By Alice Walker}~
\begin{verse}
	When you see water in a stream\\
	you say: oh, this is stream\\
	water;\\
	When you see water in the river\\
	you say: oh, this is water\\
	of the river;\\
	When you see ocean\\
	water\\
	you say: This is the ocean's\\
	water!\\
	But actually water is always\\
	only itself\\
	and does not belong\\
	to any of these containers\\
	though it creates them.\\
	And so it is with you.
\end{verse}
