\subsection*{Reduction Potentials}

Find the standard reduction potential for \ch{Cu^{2+} + 2 e- -> Cu(s)} using the following potentials:

\ch{Cu+ + e- -> Cu} \hspace{2em}$E^{\std} = 0.52~V$

\ch{Cu^{2+} + e- -> Cu+} \hspace{2em}$E^{\std} = 0.16V$

\vspace{3em}
\subsection*{Electrochemical Cells}
Find the \emph{standard} cell potential for a cell constructed after the following schema:

\ch{Ag(s)|AgCl(s)|Cl^-(aq)||Ce^{4+}(aq)/Ce^{3+}(aq)|Pt(s)}

\vspace{3em}\noindent
What is the equilibrium constant $K$ for this cell?

\vspace{3em}\noindent
\ch{Ag/AgCl} electrodes will often buffer the \ch{Cl^-(aq)} concentration by saturating the solution in \ch{KCl}. \ch{KCl} has a solubility product of $K_{sp}=21.7$, and at saturation \ch{KCl} has $\gamma_{\pm}=1.45$
 
\noindent Find the cell potential when the cell uses a saturated \ch{KCl} solution in the anode, and has $\left[\ch{Ce^{4+}}\right]=0.25~M$ and $\left[\ch{Ce^{3+}}\right]=0.75~M$ in the cathode

\vspace{6em}\noindent
Is this cell a voltaic cell or an electrolytic cell?

\vspace{3em}\noindent
Can you explain the standard redution potential of a \ch{Ag/AgCl} electrode ($+0.22~V$) using the \ch{Ag^+/Ag} standard reduction potential ($+0.80~V$) and the solubility product of \ch{AgCl} $\left(K_{sp}=1.8\times10^{-10}\right)$?

	For all we have and are,\\
	For all our children's fate,\\
	Stand up and take the war.\\
	The Hun is at the gate!\\
	Our world has passed away,\\
	In wantonness o'erthrown.\\
	There is nothing left to-day\\
	But steel and fire and stone!\\
	Though all we knew depart,\\
	The old Commandments stand:—\\
	“In courage keep your heart,\\
	In strength lift up your hand.”
	
	Once more we hear the word\\
	That sickened earth of old:—\\
	“No law except the Sword\\
	Unsheathed and uncontrolled.”\\
	Once more it knits mankind,\\
	Once more the nations go\\
	To meet and break and bind\\
	A crazed and driven foe.	
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.49\linewidth}
	Comfort, content, delight,\\
	The ages' slow-bought gain,\\
	They shrivelled in a night.\\
	Only ourselves remain\\
	To face the naked days\\
	In silent fortitude,\\
	Through perils and dismays\\
	Renewed and re-renewed.\\
	Though all we made depart,\\
	The old Commandments stand:—\\
	“In patience keep your heart,\\
	In strength lift up your hand.”
	
	No easy hope or lies\\
	Shall bring us to our goal,\\
	But iron sacrifice\\
	Of body, will, and soul.\\
	There is but one task for all—\\
	One life for each to give.\\
	What stands if Freedom fall?\\
	Who dies if England live?
