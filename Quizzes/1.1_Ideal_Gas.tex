\subsection*{Question 1}
A weather balloon starts in Cedar City with with $P=0.82~atm$, $T=21.5~^\circ C$, and $V=18.75~L$

\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the number of moles of gas inside the balloon
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\item If the balloon is filled with \ch{He} gas, find the mass of the gas inside the balloon
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\item Find the density of the \ch{He}-filled balloon (assume the instruments and balloon itself have no mass)
	
	\vspace{2em}
	\item Find the density of the surrounding air (assume it is $100\%$ \ch{N2} gas)
\end{itemize}
	
\vspace{2em}
\subsection*{Question 2}
The weather balloon is released into the upper atmosphere and the instruments on-board indicate a pressure of $0.45~atm$ and a temperature of $-32.4~^\circ C$

\noindent What will the new volume of the balloon be?

\subsection*{Question 3}
A car engine burns about $0.1~g$ of gasoline (\ch{C8H18})for each engine cycle. A car engine may have a cylinder volume of $0.075~L$ at the point of ignition, and operate at a temperature of $80.0~^\circ C$. If the gasoline combusts completely inside the $0.075~L$ piston, what is the pressure of the combustion products?

\subsection*{Question 4}
Find the following, regarding a sample of pure Helium at $25^\circ C$ and $0.800~atm$
\begin{itemize}
	\item $v_{rms}$
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item $v_{rel}$
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item Collision frequency
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item $\lambda$ (mean free path)
	
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3em}
\subsection*{Question 5}
What will be $v_{rel}$ for collisions between \ch{O2} and \ch{N2} molecules in a sample of the atmosphere at $25^\circ C$ and $0.800~atm$ $\left(\chi_{\ch{N2}}=0.80,~\chi_{\ch{O2}}=0.20\right)$

\section*{\emph{When I Heard the Learn'd Astronomer}}
\paragraph{By Walt Whitman}~

\begin{verse}	
	When I heard the learn’d astronomer,\\	
	When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,\\	
	When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,\\	
	When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much applause in the lecture-room,\\	
	How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,\\	
	Till rising and gliding out I wander’d off by myself,\\	
	In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,\\	
	Look’d up in perfect silence at the stars.
\end{verse}
