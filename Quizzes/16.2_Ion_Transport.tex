\subsection*{Conductive Materials}
A wire sample made of an unknown metal has a length of $2.5m$ and a cross-sectional area of $0.080cm^2$. The resistance of this wire sample is measured to be $12\Omega$. What is the conductivity ($\kappa$) of the unknown metal?

\vspace{4em}\noindent
An outdoor grounding wire must be designed to safely carry a very high current, as from a lightning strike. Copper wire has conductivity of $5.8\times10^7\frac{1}{\Omega~m}$. Find the resistance of a wire made from pure copper, with $l=25m$ and $A=0.22cm^2$

\subsection*{Electrolyte Conductivity}
In water at $298K$, \ch{Ca^{2+}} has an ion mobility of $u=6.17\times10^{-8}\frac{m^2}{V~s}$ and \ch{Br^-} has an ion mobility of \\$u=8.09\times10^{-8}\frac{m^2}{V~s}$. Use the viscosity of water ($0.00089\frac{kg}{m~s}$) to find the Stokes radius of each ion

\vspace{5em}\noindent
Find the molar conductivity of a solution of \ch{CaBr2}

\vspace{4em}\noindent
Two electrodes with $A=6.0cm^2$ are placed $1.5cm$ apart in a $0.75~M$ \ch{CaBr2} solution. Find the resistance across the electrolyte solution

\vspace{6em}\noindent
If $120V$ are placed across the electrodes, how long does it take a \ch{Ca^{2+}} ion to traverse from one electrode to the other?

\section*{\emph{Because I Could Not Stop for Death (479)}}
\paragraph{By Emily Dickinson}~
\begin{verse}
	Because I could not stop for Death –\\
	He kindly stopped for me –\\
	The Carriage held but just Ourselves –\\
	And Immortality.
	
	We slowly drove – He knew no haste\\
	And I had put away\\
	My labor and my leisure too,\\
	For His Civility –
	
	We passed the School, where Children strove\\
	At Recess – in the Ring –\\
	We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –\\
	We passed the Setting Sun –
	
	Or rather – He passed Us –\\
	The Dews drew quivering and Chill –\\
	For only Gossamer, my Gown –\\
	My Tippet – only Tulle –
	
	We paused before a House that seemed\\
	A Swelling of the Ground –\\
	The Roof was scarcely visible –\\
	The Cornice – in the Ground –
	
	Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet\\
	Feels shorter than the Day\\
	I first surmised the Horses' Heads\\
	Were toward Eternity –
\end{verse}
