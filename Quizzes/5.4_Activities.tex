\subsection*{Activities and $\xi$} 
A mixture is made by dissolving $0.025~moles$ of substance $B$ into $1.5~moles$ of substance $A$. These two substances have endothermic mixing, with $\xi=0.63$. Use the Margules equations to find $\gamma_A$ and $\gamma_B$

\subsection*{Extended Debye-H\"uckel Law} 
\noindent
Consider a solution made by adding $0.75~moles$ of \ch{NaCl} and $1.50~moles$ of \ch{Fe(NO3)3} to $1.00~kg$ of water solvent

\noindent
Find the activity coefficients $\gamma_{\pm}$ for \ch{NaCl} and \ch{Fe(NO3)3} in this solution. Use the extended Debye-H\"uckel law, with $A=0.5085$ and $B=0.9843$ (values for water at $25^\circ C$ and typical ion sizes).

\subsection*{Debye-H\"uckel Limiting Law}
\noindent
\ch{CaF2} is a sparingly soluble salt whose solubility product is $K_{SP}=1.6\times10^{-10}$. Give the molar concentration of \ch{CaF2} in $\circled{1}$ pure water, and $\circled{2}$ an aqueous solution buffered with $0.50~molal$ \ch{NaNO3}. Use the Debye-H\"uckel limiting law, with $A=0.5085$

\section*{\emph{My Voice}}
\paragraph{By Rafael Campo}~
\begin{verse}
	To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,\\
	I wrote a Cuban song about the need\\
	For people to suppress their fantasies,\\
	Especially unhealthy ones. The song\\
	Began by making reference to the sea,\\
	Because the sea is like a need so great\\
	And deep it never can be swallowed. Then\\
	The song explores some common myths\\
	About the Cuban people and their folklore:\\
	The story of a little Carib boy\\
	Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;\\
	The legend of a bird who wanted song\\
	So desperately he gave up flight; a queen\\
	Whose strength was greater than a rival kingâ€™s.\\
	The song goes on about morality,\\
	And then there is a line about the sea,\\
	How deep it is, how many creatures need\\
	Its nourishment, how beautiful it is\\
	To need. The song is ending now, because\\
	I cannot bear to hear it any longer.\\
	I call this song of needful love my voice.
