\section*{\emph{Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?}}
\paragraph{By William Shakespeare}~
\begin{verse}
	Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\\
	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:\\
	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\\
	And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;\\
	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\\
	And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\\
	And every fair from fair sometime declines,\\
	By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;\\
	But thy eternal summer shall not fade,\\
	Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;\\
	Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\\
	When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:\\
	\hspace{0.5em} So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\\
	\hspace{0.5em} So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
\end{verse}
