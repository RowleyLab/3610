\subsection*{The Equilibrium Constant}
Consider the reaction below:

 \ch{PCl5(g) <=> PCl3(g) + Cl2(g)} \hspace{3em} $K_C(25^\circ C) = 0.0160$

\noindent $\circ$ Find the value of $K_p$ for this reaction at $25^\circ C$

\vspace{6em}
\noindent $\circ$ Find the value of $\Delta G^{\std}_{rxn}$ for this reaction at $25^\circ C$ \\
(*Note that the standard state for all chemical species in this reaction is a gas at $1~bar$*)

\vspace{6em}
\noindent $\circ$ Find the value of $\Delta G_{rxn}$ when $p_{\ch{PCl5}}=0.53~bar$, $p_{\ch{PCl3}}=0.22~bar$, and $p_{\ch{Cl2}}=0.47~bar$

\subsection*{Le Ch\^atelier's Principle}

Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas, can be produced by reacting methane with water in the reaction below:

\ch{CH4(g) + H2O(g) <=> CO(g) + 3 H2(g)} \hspace{2em} $\Delta_{rxn}H^{\std}(273~K)=206.13~\nicefrac{kJ}{mol}$

\noindent You are a chemical engineer designing a new syngas production plant, and you want to maximize the amount of syngas produced (maximize $\xi$) at equilibrium.$^*$

\noindent $\circ$ Should you run the reaction at high or low temperature?

\vspace{2em}
\noindent $\circ$ Should you run the reaction with high partial pressures or low partial pressures?

\vspace{2em}
\noindent *Really, chemical engineers consider far more diverse and complex factors when designing plants

\subsection*{The van't Hoff Equation}
Consider the reaction below:

\ch{H2(g) + Br2(g) <=> 2 HBr(g)}

\noindent
This reaction is carried out at two temperatures while monitoring equilibrium composition. At $25^\circ C$, the reaction has $K=62.5$, and at $175^\circ C$ the reaction has $K=0.00343$.\\
Use these data to find $\Delta H^{\std}_{rxn}$ for this reaction.

\vspace{10em}
\noindent What is the value of $K$ at $-15^\circ C$?

\vspace{10em}
\noindent At what temperature is $K=1.00$?

\vspace{10em}
\noindent At right, draw a rough van't Hoff plot for this reaction, including:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Equation for the best fit line
	\item Relationship for the slope
	\item $K$ in the high temperature limit
	\item $K$ in the low temperature limit
\end{itemize}

\section*{\emph{God Says Yes to Me}}
\paragraph{By Kaylin Haught}~
\begin{verse}
	I asked God if it was okay to be melodramatic\\
	and she said yes\\
	I asked her if it was okay to be short\\
	and she said it sure is\\
	I asked her if I could wear nail polish\\
	or not wear nail polish\\
	and she said honey\\
	she calls me that sometimes\\
	she said you can do just exactly\\
	what you want to\\
	Thanks God I said\\
	And is it even okay if I don’t paragraph\\
	my letters\\
	Sweetcakes God said\\
	who knows where she picked that up\\
	what I’m telling you is\\
	Yes Yes Yes
\end{verse}
