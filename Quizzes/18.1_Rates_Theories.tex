\subsection*{Collision Theory}
Nitrogen monoxide can be produced by the reaction:

\ch{N2 + O2 -> 2 NO}

\noindent Find the encounter rate ($Z$) for this reaction in the atmosphere ($p_{\ch{N2}}\approx0.8atm$ and $p_{\ch{O2}}\approx0.2~atm$), then give an expression for the reaction rate.

\vspace{12em}
\subsection*{Diffusion-Controlled Reactions}
 The rate constant of diffusion controlled reactions depends only on the temperature and the solvent viscosity (if the reaction distance is the same as the Stokes radius of the reactants). Find the rate constant $k_d$ in water at $298K$ for such reactions. (recall that for water at room temperature  $\eta=0.00089\frac{kg}{m~s}$)

\subsection*{Transition-State Theory}

\section*{\emph{Invictus}}
\paragraph{By William Ernest Henley}~
\begin{verse}
	Out of the night that covers me,\\
	\hspace{1em}Black as the pit from pole to pole,\\
	I thank whatever gods may be\\
	\hspace{1em}For my unconquerable soul.
	
	In the fell clutch of circumstance\\
	\hspace{1em}I have not winced nor cried aloud.\\
	Under the bludgeonings of chance\\
	\hspace{1em}My head is bloody, but unbowed.
	
	Beyond this place of wrath and tears\\
	\hspace{1em}Looms but the Horror of the shade,\\
	And yet the menace of the years\\
	\hspace{1em}Finds and shall find me unafraid.
	
	It matters not how strait the gate,\\
	\hspace{1em}How charged with punishments the scroll,\\
	I am the master of my fate,\\
	\hspace{1em}I am the captain of my soul.
\end{verse}
