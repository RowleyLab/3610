\subsection*{Natural Variables}
Write the exact differentials for the four main thermodynamic potentials ($U$, $H$, $G$, and $A$) with respect to their natural variables in two forms: (The Wikipedia page on “Thermodynamic Potentials” can be very helpful here, but Helmholtz energy is $F$ instead of $A$ on that page)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Showing the partial derivatives explicitly
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item Replacing the partial derivatives with the appropriate state variables
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3em}
\subsection*{Properties of Ideal gases}
Find the following properties in terms of state variables (i.e. solve the derivatives) for an ideal gas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\pi_T$
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item $\alpha$
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item $\kappa_T$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3em}
\subsection*{Joule-Thompson Coefficients}
The Joule-Thompson coefficient is positive for most gases under most conditions. State the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What conditions will lead to a negative coefficient for most gases?
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\item Give an example of a gas with a negative coefficient at STP
\end{itemize}

\section*{\emph{Ozymandius}}
\paragraph{By Percy Bysshe Shelley}~
\begin{verse}
	I met a traveller from an antique land,\\
	Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone\\
	Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,\\
	Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\\
	And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\\
	Tell that its sculptor well those passions read\\
	Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\\
	The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\\
	And on the pedestal, these words appear:\\
	My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;\\
	Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!\\
	Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\\
	Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare\\
	The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
\end{verse}
